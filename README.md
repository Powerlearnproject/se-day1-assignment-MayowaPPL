Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
#**Answer**
Software engineering is a branch of engineering that involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of
high quality software.
It is very important in the technology industry as it enable the development of software applications and systems that are useful
in the area of communication, commerce, health care, entertainment, education, among others.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
#**Answer** 
i) Development of programming languages: many programming languages have emerged over the years. Among them are C, C++, Java and 
the likes of JavaScript, Python which are now very common in use.
ii) Establishment of Software Engineering disciplines: software engineering degrees are now being offered by many universities across the globe.
iii) Adoption of Agile methodologies: new methodologies such as the Agile methods have also been developed to Fastrack project management in
the area of software engineering


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
#**Answer**
i) Requirement: this involves research and documentation of user needs and requirements.
ii) Design: involves creating a well detailed software architectural design and user interface.
iii) Implementation: involves writing codes to build software that meet design specifications.
iv) Testing: involves testing the built software to ensure it meets standard functional requirements.
v) Deployment: involves the release of tested software to users for use.
vi) Maintenance: involves the provision of support, enhancements and updates to deployed software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
#**Answer**
Waterfall methodology employs a sequential approach with distinct phase. On the other hand, Agile methodology employs an iterative 
and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
#**Answers**
i) Software Developer: responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions
ii) Quality Assurance Engineer: responsible for ensuring a software meets user requirements and specifications.
iii) Project Manager: responsible for managing all processes of planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
#**Answer**
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are suites that provide programmers with comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and 
testing code, for example, VS Code, Ellipse, etc.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that enable programmers to track changes to source code and collaborate with other programmers on a 
common project among team members, for example, Git and GitHub.
These tools are very important in that they enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features with the features they provide.
 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
#**Answer**
Some common challenged faced by software engineers encounter include:
i) Changing Requirements
ii) Tight Deadlines
iii) Technical Debt
These can be overcome by the following strategies:
i) Effective communication among all stakeholders.
ii) Employment of agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
#**Answer**
Unit Testing: this involves testing the individual component or module of a given software.
Integration Testing: involves testing the interactions between the different components or subsystems.
System Testing: involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: involves testing the software to ensure that it meets user requirement and specification.
These different testing methods help software developers to identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
#**Answer**
Prompt engineering is defined as the crafting or writing of specific, concise and clear instructions and questions that an AI model can read and execute properly. It is very vital in interactions of human with AI model as it help AI to provide the right and best responses to these questions and instructions. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
#**Answer**
Vague Prompt: What is Jollof rice?
Improved Response: In simple terms, explain the preparation of a delicious Nigerian Jollof rice that fits an available budget of N3,000.
The improved prompt is more specific. It is also targeted at some conditions which helps the AI to know the exact response to give.
